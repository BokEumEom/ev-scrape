# React Project Overview

This document provides an overview of a React project developed using Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS, and utilizing several key libraries to enhance functionality and developer experience.

## Project Structure

Refer to the "Project Structure" section for a detailed breakdown of the directory and file structure. This section outlines the organization of components, assets, services, hooks, and more.

## Key Libraries

This project incorporates a selection of libraries essential for modern React development, ensuring efficient data fetching, state management, routing, and form handling.

- **@tanstack/react-query**: Enables fetching, caching, and updating asynchronous data in React applications. It simplifies state management for remote data.
- **axios**: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to external services. Used in conjunction with React Query for data fetching.
- **react-router-dom**: Manages navigation within the application, enabling dynamic routing in a web app.
- **react-hook-form**: Simplifies form handling in React. It reduces the amount of boilerplate needed to create complex forms and manage their state.
- **tailwindcss**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing quickly and customizing your site directly in your markup.
- **react-dom**: Serves as the entry point to the DOM and server renderers for React. It provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app.

## Getting Started

To begin working on the project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Execute `npm install` to download and install the project's dependencies.
2. **Development Server**: Launch the development server with `npm run dev`. This provides hot reloading and error reporting in development mode.
3. **Build**: Compile the application for production using `npm run build`.
4. **Preview**: To preview the production build, run `npm run preview`.

## Additional Information

- Tailwind CSS is configured via `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`, allowing for extensive customization.
- TypeScript enhances development by providing type safety. Configure or extend TypeScript settings in `tsconfig.json`.
- The project structure is designed for scalability and maintainability, separating concerns into modules like components, hooks, services, etc.
